# Code Atlas

> Shared rules for all projects: `~/Projects/AGENTS.md` and `~/Projects/atelier-astra/AGENTS.md` (worktrees,

## What it is
An internal Atelier Astra tool: a terminal code editor that feels like IntelliJ IDEA (type straight away, IDEA
shortcuts) with an optional Vim mode, project view, code smarts over LSP, git, a terminal pane, and a panel to
run and watch Claude agents. Binary: `catlas`.

## Where it runs
Locally in a terminal on the Mac and the laptop (`catlas [file ...]`). No server. Best in a terminal with the
kitty keyboard protocol (Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2 with "CSI u" on): it is needed for Ctrl+Shift combos.

## Stack
Rust 2021 (Mac: `~/.cargo/bin`, not on PATH; laptop: pacman `rust`). `ratatui` 0.29 + `crossterm` 0.28 (screen,
input), `ropey` (text buffer), `unicode-width`. Planned: `tree-sitter` (highlighting), `lsp-types` + own JSON-RPC
client (LSP), `portable-pty` + `vt100` (terminal pane), `git` CLI or `gix` (git).

## Layout
- `src/main.rs` – terminal setup/restore, event loop.
- `src/doc.rs` – one open file: rope, cursor/selection (char offsets), undo/redo snapshots, all edit commands, unit tests.
- `src/app.rs` – tabs, clipboard, prompts (find, go to line, save as), IDEA key map, mouse.
- `src/ui.rs` – drawing (tab bar, gutter, text, status bar) and the `theme` colours (Ledger Terminal dark tokens).
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` – milestones and who owns which files. `docs/decisions/` – project decisions.

## Run & test
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cargo test                 # unit tests (doc.rs edit logic)
cargo run -- some/file.rs  # try it
cargo build --release      # target/release/catlas
```
End-to-end check without a human: run it in tmux, send keys, read the screen:
`tmux new-session -d -s ca -x 90 -y 16 "target/release/catlas f.rs"; tmux send-keys -t ca -l 'text'; tmux capture-pane -t ca -p`.

## Deploy
None yet. Later: `cargo install --path .` on the Mac and the laptop.

## Conventions
- Positions are **char offsets** into the rope; on-screen columns are display columns (`Doc::display_col`, tabs = 4).
- Every edit goes through `Doc::begin(kind)` so undo works; runs of typing/deleting group into one step.
- Keys follow IntelliJ's default Windows/Linux keymap (see `app.rs` `key()`); terminal-impossible keys get a
  documented fallback (Ctrl+Shift+Z redo → also Alt+Z).
- Colours only from `ui::theme`. Line endings of a file are kept (LF/CRLF).
- New features go in their own module (`src/<feature>/…`) with a small hook in `app.rs`/`ui.rs`, so parallel work
  doesn't collide.

## Gotchas
- Terminals without the kitty protocol can't send Ctrl+Shift+letter, Ctrl+/ arrives as Ctrl+7 or Ctrl+_,
  Ctrl+Backspace as Ctrl+H. macOS Terminal.app lacks the protocol.
- Shift+Shift ("search everywhere") needs key *release* events (kitty `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES`); plan a fallback.
- System clipboard: copy goes out via pbcopy / wl-copy / xclip / OSC 52; paste from outside arrives as a
  bracketed paste (Cmd+V / Ctrl+Shift+V), Ctrl+V pastes the editor's own clipboard.

## Decisions
`docs/decisions/0001-stack-and-keymap.md` – Rust + ratatui, IDEA keys by default, Vim optional, internal tool.

## Current state (2026-10-25)
M1 core editing done (tabs, undo/redo, selection, bracket pairing, smart Enter/Home, duplicate/delete/move line,
find, go to line, mouse, clipboard). M2–M6 assigned to Aa staff, see `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
